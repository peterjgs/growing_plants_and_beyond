# Plants

## Plant classification

Plants can be classified in more than one way. The method you choose depends on what differences you want to highlight.

One method divides plants into those with vascular tissue and those with non-vascular tissue. Vascular tissue transports water and nutrients up the roots and stems. The diagram below is simplified and does not include all plant groups. As it is based on whether vascular tissue is present, it highlights the evolution of water independence in plants. Non-vascular plants (e.g. mosses) need to live in or near a moist environment. Vascular plants (e.g. ferns and seed-bearing plants), on the other hand, can live in drier environments as they can obtain water through their roots.

Dividing plants into spore-bearing and seed-bearing plants focusses on the ways in which plants reproduce. Gymnosperms and angiosperms bear seeds, while all other plants reproduce via spores. Seeds gave plants a better chance of survival.

Ferns are the class Filicinae.

Gymnosperms are a class and include the orders Conifers, Cycads and Gingko. They produce seeds in cones and do not flower.

Angiosperms are a class and are divided into the sub-classes Monocots (or Liliopsida) (e.g. palms, grasses) and Dicots (or Magnoliopsida) (e.g. flowering trees, shrubs and climbers) and produce seeds in flowers.

Under Kingdom, the next taxonomic rank is division (in botany) and phylum (in zoology).

Subfamily:  -oideae


## Primary and secondary growth

Primary growth results from cell division in the tips of the stem and roots and results in the stems and roots lengthening.

Secondary growth results from cell division in the cambium, producing xylem on the inside and phloem on the outside and so causing the stem to thicken. Secondary growth occurs in dicots and gymnosperms but not usually in monocots. Monocots may have "anomalous secondary growth". Palms, for example, increase their stem diameter by parenchyma cells dividing and enlarging, a process where no secondary xylem or phloem is formed (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_growth). Parenchyma cells are a type of *ground tissue*, which is tissue that is not on the external surface of plants or part of vascular tissue. It's a type of "filler" tissue in the soft parts of plants (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_tissue). There are different types of anomalous secondary growth in other monocots.

## Plant characteristics

When talking about the type and life form of a plant, move from left to right through the characteristics below.

|  Lifetime  | Primary/Secondary Growth |            |
|:----------:|:------------------------:|:----------:|
| Annual     |            |  Grow, flower, seed and die in one year or less |
| Perennial  |  Softwood  |  Evergreen  |
| Perennial  |  Softwood  |  Herbaceous |
| Perennial  |  Hardwood  |  Trees, shrubs, climbers |

When describing the features of a plant, do it in the order below for consistency!

**Habit**

- include stem characteristics


**Leaf**

- arrangement
- shape
- size
- margin type
- texture and surfaces
- colour
- scent

**Flowers**

- inflorescence type
- position
- flower shape
- size
- colour
- scent
- season

## Plant tissues

Note: References are from: RAV - Raven et al., *The Biology of Plants*

After the embryo has formed, new plant cells are produced by the **meristems**. Meristems are tissues (i.e. tissues are groups of cells that are similar and perform specific functions) where cells that are undifferentiated undergo cell division by mitosis. 

There are two main types of meristem (RAV, p. 6):

- apical meristem - are at tips of shoots and roots and are involved with extension growth of the plant (i.e. often vertical growth) - this type of growth is primary growth

- lateral meristem - this consists of the vascular cambium and cork cambium, which are involved with increasing the thickness or girth of stems, branches and roots - this type of growth is secondary growth

In both apical and lateral meristems, some cells can repeatedly divide; one of the cells produced stays in the meristem ("initial"), the other eventually becomes a new plant body cell ("derivative) - these two new cells are not different from each other, but take on their roles from their position in the meristem (RAV, p. 453). 

There are three types of primary meristem:

- protoderm - produces the future epidermis, a single layer of cells forming the outermost layer of the stem

- ground meristem - produces the ground tissue (mostly parenchyma cells), which in a stem, surrounds the vascular tissue

- procambium - produces the vascular tissue (i.e. xylem and phloem)

These three tissues are primary meristems because (RAV, p. 454):

- they produce primary tissues

- many of their cells can divide and remain undifferentiated for some time (i.e. they can divide again) before they differentiate into specific types of cell
