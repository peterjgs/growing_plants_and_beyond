The method you choose depends on what differences you want to highlight. One method divides plants into those with vascular tissue and those with non-vascular tissue. Vascular tissue transports water and nutrients up the roots and stems. The diagram below is simplified and does not include all plant groups. As it is based on whether vascular tissue is present, it highlights the evolution of water independence in plants. Non-vascular plants (e.g. mosses) need to live in or near a moist environment. Vascular plants (e.g. ferns and seed-bearing plants), on the other hand, can live in drier environments as they can obtain water through their roots. Dividing plants into spore-bearing and seed-bearing plants focusses on the ways in which plants reproduce. Gymnosperms and angiosperms bear seeds, while all other plants reproduce via spores. Seeds gave plants a better chance of survival. (Reference: https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/Book%3A_Introductory_Biology_(CK-12)/09%3A_Plants/9.06%3A_Plant_Classification) Ferns are the class Filicinae. Gymnosperms are a class and include the orders Conifers, Cycads and Gingko. They produce seeds in cones and do not flower. Angiosperms are a class and are divided into the sub-classes Monocots (or Liliopsida) (e.g. palms, grasses) and Dicots (or Magnoliopsida) (e.g. flowering trees, shrubs and climbers) and produce seeds in flowers. Under Kingdom, the next taxonomic rank is division (in botany) and phylum (in zoology). 2.1.1 Suffixes in taxonomic ranks in botany (See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank) Division: -ophyta Class: -opsida Subclass: -idae Order: -ales Family: -aceae Subfamily: -oideae 2.2 Primary and secondary growth Primary growth results from cell division in the tips of the stem and roots and results in the stems and roots lengthening. Secondary growth results from cell division in the cambium, producing xylem on the inside and phloem on the outside and so causing the stem to thicken. Secondary growth occurs in dicots and gymnosperms but not usually in monocots. Monocots may have “anomalous secondary growth”. Palms, for example, increase their stem diameter by parenchyma cells dividing and enlarging, a process where no secondary xylem or phloem is formed (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_growth). Parenchyma cells are a type of ground tissue, which is tissue that is not on the external surface of plants or part of vascular tissue. It’s a type of “filler” tissue in the soft parts of plants (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_tissue). There are different types of anomalous secondary growth in other monocots.

The qualities of growing media must match the growth phase of the plants: seed germination / rooting cuttings, potting up, potting on. 3.6.1 Seed propagation free from pests and disease high water-holding capacity to maintain uniform moisture around seeds 3.6.2 Cuttings free from pests and disease very porous good drainage, as cuttings are often misted and so the growing medium must not become waterlogged high aeration or air-filled porosity (i.e. a high percentage of macropores) to encourage root growth 3.6.3 Transplant or potting on media Plants in this growth phase have actively growing roots, shoots and leaves, can support themselves, absorb nutrients and produce their own food. free from pests and disease coarser than seed propagation or cuttings media well-aerated and drained (i.e. holding more air (oxygen)) good water-holding and nutrient holding capacity to satisfy the needs of actively growing plants (i.e. actively growing roots, shoots and leaves) initially, water-holding capacity is less than seed raising and tubing up mixes but increases as organic components decompose heavy enough so plants stay upright (i.e. more sand) may contain some fertiliser N.B. The type of potting mix used for potting on depends on the type of plant, the conditions (e.g. more protected or less protected) it will grow under, season and irrigation method. Potting on mixes can be general or made to suit the needs of particular plants (e.g. orchids, azaleas). 3.6.4 Establishment media In this growth phase, plants have well-developed root and shoot systems and can support themselves, absorb nutrients and produce and store their own food. They need to be able to cope with an environment with few climatic controls. The emphasis here is on keeping the plant healthy and not encouraging it to grow excessively. free from pests and disease lower aeration and drainage than other mixes to allow for slower growth rates and less maintenance high water-holding and nutrient-holding capacity (due to less maintenance) ballast (i.e. more sand) for stability for plants remaining in containers for the long-term, the media must resist decomposing - the particles must remain stable to maintain growing conditions; sand can be used to provide the smallest particles "],["weeds.html", "4 Weeds 4.1 Weeding techniques", " 4 Weeds 4.1 Weeding techniques 4.1.1 Crowning The crown is the part of the plant that sits just below the surface of the soil.
