Clay is the “flesh” that supports a lot of the chemical, physical and biological activity in soil. Much of the material on mineralogy below comes from: Essington, M. 2004. Soil and Water Chemistry: An Integrative Approach, CRC Press, Chapter 2. 1.2 Soil mineralogy - introductory ideas Minerals in soils can be crystalline - these are naturally occurring inorganic compounds with atoms in a 3-D structure that repeats amorphous - these are naturally occurring inorganic compounds with no repeating structure The O2- anion is the dominant anion in soil minerals (47% by weight). The coordination number is the number of anions that can be packed around a cation with no overlap. The bigger the cation, the more anions that can fit around it. The figure below from Essington shows how charges of bonds are counted. First, a definition: bond strength = cation valence / coordination number. On the left are silicon tetrahedra, with the Si4+ ions in tetrahedral coordination, each surrounded by four O2- ions. The strength of each Si-O bond is +4 / 4 = +1. The tetrahedra are bonded through a shared basal corner O2- ion. The 2- charge on the O ion is exactly balanced by the 1+ charge on each of the two Si ions it’s bonded to. On the right hand side are Al3+ ions in octahedral coordination, each surrounded by six OH- ions. The strength of each Al-OH bond is +3 / 6 = +1/2. Consequently, each OH- ion can only be bonded by two Al3+ ions. The -2 charge on each O2- ion is exactly balanced by its bond with two Al3+ ions and one H+ ion. Figure 1.1: Essington, Fig. 2.5, p. 41 A unit cell of a crystal is the smallest three-dimensional repeating unit of atoms. The most commonly occurring minerals in soil are the silicates. One class of silicates, the phyllosilicates or clay minerals, has a substantial effect on the physical and chemical properties of soil. The primary silicate minerals formed as liquid magma cooled and make up the bulk of the sand- and silt-sized fractions of soil. The secondary silicate minerals, formed from the weathering of the primary silicates or from precipitation of soluble mineral material, are found mainly in the clay fraction of soil and are responsible for many chemical reactions in soils. 1.3 Climate 1.3.1 Moisture In moist or humid climates, water moves downwards, on balance, for most of the year. This leads to leaching of soluble minerals and translocation downwards of clay particles. In arid climates, water moves upwards, on balance, over the year. This leads to salts being brought up the soil profile and closer to the surface. 1.3.2 Temperature Temperature affects the rate of mineral weathering and formation and biological processes, such as growth and decomposition. 1.4 Parent material Rocks are classified as igneous, sedimentary or metamorphic. Notes below are based on: https://australian.museum/learn/minerals/shaping-earth/classification-of-igneous-rocks/ 1.4.1 Igneous rocks these are formed by the solidification of molten magma in the Earth’s crust or on the surface of the Earth’s crust they are divided into classes based on grain size and silica content: grain size volcanic rocks - they solidify close to the Earth’s surface and so cool quickly; they have finer grains plutonic rocks - they solidify deep in the Earth’s crust and cool slowly; they have coarse grains silica content acidic - rocks with more than 63% silica (mostly light-coloured K/Na feldspars and quartz); mainly instrusive (i.e. forming within the crust) - e.g. granite basic - rocks with 45% to 55% quartz but high in dark-coloured ferromagnesian minerals (i.e. Fe and Mg) and Ca feldspars; mainly extrusive (i.e. forming on Earth’s surface from lava) - e.g. basalt 1.4.2 Metamorphic rocks Igneous and sedimentary rocks that are subjected to high temperature and pressure have their mineral composition and structure changed and are transformed into metamorphic rocks. Under high temperature and pressure, existing minerals break down and form new minerals. Particular pressure/temperature conditions cause particular index minerals to form and these minerals can be used as one classifying feature of metamorphic rocks. Apart from index minerals, other classifying features are grain size and degree of foliation. Texture: foliated (leaf-like layers) - newly formed minerals align themselves perpendicular to the direction of stress; metamorphic rocks break easily along foliation planes non-foliated, massive or granular - a granular texture develops if a rock’s chemical composition is similar to that of a particular mineral (e.g. marble - see below) As the grade of metamorphism increases (i.e. higher pressure and temperature), crystal size increases and foliation becomes coarser (e.g. in limestone, calcite recrystallises into larger crystals and forms marble). Grain size Foliation Fine Coarse Poor Hornfels Marble, quartzite Good Slate Gneiss 1.4.3 Sedimentary rocks These are composed of the products of the weathering of igneous and metamorphic rocks and are formed when these products are deposited by wind or water. As more and more sediment layers are laid down, they exert weight on deeper sediments, which harden and form rock. Some sedimentary rocks form by precipitation of minerals, such as limestone. 1.5 Chain silicates In the figure below, silicon tetrahedra are shwon linked into single chains (top) and double chains (bottom). Pyroxenes are made up of single chains of silicon tetrahedra linked through basal oxygen atoms. The basic unit is SiO32-. How do you get this unit formula? Each Si-O bond has a strength of +4 / 4 = +1. The four O atoms in a single tetrahedron in focus are numbered. O no. 1 is shared with the neighbouring Si atom, so only half of it “belongs to” the tetrahedron in question. O nos. 2 and 3 both belong wholly to the focal tetrahedron. Like O no. 1, only half of O no. 4 is counted. So, there are one Si atom and three O atoms in the basic pyroxene unit, giving SiO32-. Amphiboles are made up of double chains of silicon tetrahedra linked through basal oxygen atoms. The basic unit is Si4O112-. How so? The Si atoms are numbered 1 to 4. The set of tetrahedra with these Si atoms constitutes the basic repeating unit of the chains. Some of the oxygen atoms in this unit are marked in groups (with A, B and C), while the other six O atoms in the repeating unit are unmarked. Again, each Si-O bond has a strength of +1. The six unmarked O atoms in the unit belong wholly to the unit and contribute their full value. Contribution here is 6. O atoms marked A are shared with Si atoms in neighbouring tetrahedra, so each contributes half to the basic unit. Contribution here is 2. One of the O atoms marked B is shared between Si atoms 1 and 2 (i.e. half with each Si atom), both of which are in the basic unit, so that O atom contributes its full worth. The other O atom marked B is shared in the same way with Si atoms 3 and 4 and also contributes its full worth. Contribution here is 2. Oxygen atom C is shared in a similar way to the Bs, so also contributes its full worth. Contribution here is 1. Total oxygen “value” is 11. This gives the basic unit of Si4O112-. Figure 1.2: Essington, Fig. 2.10, p. 49 1.6 Phyllosilicates Phyllosilicates are sheet silicates or layer silicates. The basic unit is Si2O52-. Each individual tetrahedron shares three basal O atoms, as shown below. The result is a sheet structure. Figure 1.3: Essington, Fig. 2.11, p. 50 An example of primary phyllosilicate minerals is the micas. They are 2:1 layer silicates - i.e. two silicate tetrahedral sheets sandwiching an octahedral sheet. The basic unit of the octahedral sheets is three octahedra. If two out of the three positions available in the octahedra for cations are occupied by cations, the sheet is dioctahedral. If all three positions are occupied, the sheet is trioctahedral. Isomorphous substitution occurs when an atom replaces another atom which has a similar size - e.g. Al3+ can replace Si4+ in a tetrahedral sheet and Fe2+, Fe3+ or Mg2+ can replace Al3+ in octahedral sheets. If Al3+ substitutes for Si4+ in a tetrahedral layer in a dioctahedral mica, there will be a charge deficit of -1. This is balanced by K+ ions in the interlayer space. In trioctahedral micas, the three octahedral spaces are occupied by divalent cations (e.g. Mg2+) to maintain the charge balance. If Al3+ substitutes for Si4+ in a tetrahedral layer in a trioctahedral mica, there will be a charge deficit of -1. This is balanced by K+ ions in the interlayer space, as in the dioctahedral case. 1.7 Clay mineralogy Clay minerals or clay material is made up of: phyllosilicates, of which there are three types, based on the ratio of tetrahedral to octahedral sheets 1:1 2:1 interlayered 1:1, 2:1 and octahedra accessory minerals - i.e. metal oxides, hydroxides and oxyhydroxides and organic matter. 1.7.1 1:1 phyllosilicates Dioctahedral: kaolinite group Kaolinite is probably the most common aluminosilicate mineral in soil. Its 1:1 layers are held together quite tightly by hydrogen bonding. It has low CEC (it has a little isomorphous substitution and also has some edge charge due to protonation and deprotonation). Trioctahedral: serpentine group 1.7.2 2:1 phyllosilicates These minerals are can be grouped according to layer charge. The mica group, which consists of primary minerals, has a layer charge of about 0.6 to 2, due to isomorphous substitution (note that vermiculite is a secondary mineral derived from mica). The smectite group has a layer charge of up to about 0.6 and includes both dioctahedral and trioctahedral minerals. As the layer charge of smectites is fairly low, water molecules and hydrated cations can get between the 2:1 layers. The hydrated cations in the interlayer space that satisfy the charge can be displaced and are exchangeable. The vermiculite group has a charge between about 0.6 and 0.9. Even though the layer charge is higher than the smectites, water and hydrated cations can still get between the 2:1 layers. 1.7.3 Interlayered 1:1, 2:1 and octahedra This group includes, for example, the chlorite group, which is interlayered octahedral. 1.8 Accessory minerals These are mainly various oxides of Al, FeIII, Mn and Si. They are amphoteric - i.e. they can carry positive or negative charge depending on the characteristics of the soil solution. Gibbsite, Al(OH)3, is a ubiquitous metal hydroxide, occurring particularly in highly weathered soils. Compounds of iron are also very common, with goethite, FeOOH, the most common hydrous iron oxide. Iron oxides accumulate in highly weathered soils, especially those that form from the weathering of basic rocks. All the iron oxides form by precipitation. Haematite, an FeIII oxide, Fe2O3, often occurs with goethite. 1.9 Surface charge - and CEC Cations (and anions) are adsorbed onto the surfaces of clay minerals and oxides owing to: permanent negative charge on clay minerals due to isomorphous substitution the amphoteric properties (i.e. can be negatively or positively charged) of the edges of kaolinite and the oxides and oxyhydroxides of Fe and Al. The cation (or anion) charge adsorbed gives the cation exchange capacity (or CEC) of the mineral. Analogously, there is also the anion exchange capacity (AEC). For crystalline 1:1 and 2:1 phyllosilicates, permanent negative charge and so CEC is more important. Note CEC varies quite a lot within mineral groups. In 2:1 clays, illites, for example, have a low CEC, as a lot of the charge is neutralised by interlayer K+, which is non-exchangeable. In vermiculites, however, the interlayer Ca2+ and Mg2+ are exchangeable and so the CEC is high. In sesquioxides, the charge depends on pH. Sesquioxides are positively charged up to a pH of 8 and so contribute nothing to CEC. 1.10 Soil organic matter About 20% to 40% of what a plant produces through photosynthesis in a growing season is returned to the soil. Plant cells are made up mostly of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Of the carbohydrates, sugars and starch are decomposed quickly, while celluose is less easily decomposed. Proteins are quickly decomposed ultimately into amino acids. Some of the amino acids are used by micro-organisms for growth. Whether there is any surplus amino-N that is mineralised for plants to use depends on the C:N ratio of the substrate material and the type of micro-organisms. When the C:N &gt; 25, there is no excess N and all N is immobilised by the micro-organisms. When C:N &lt; 25, some mineralisation (see glossary) of N is likely. Lignin, a complex phenolic polymer, makes up 10% to 20% of cereal straw dry matter and 20% to 30% of wood dry matter. It is not easily decomposed. When it is decomposed, monocyclic phenols are formed and these are then used by soil organisms to make humic macro-molecules. 1.11 Soil organisms One way of classifying soil organisms is by the method they use to make food: heterotrophs need C in the form of organic molecules; they include many species of bacteria and all fungi; autotrophs include remaining bacteria and most algae; can grow using C from CO2, deriving energy from sunlight (i.e. photosynthetic bacteria and algae) or else deriving energy from oxidising inorganic compounds (i.e. chemoautotrophs). Another way of classifying them is according to their need for molecular O2: aerobes need O2 as the terminal electron acceptor in respiration facultative anaerobes normally need O2 but can survive in anoxic conditions by using NO3- and other inorganic compounds as electron acceptors in respiration obligate anaerobes grow only in oxygen-free environments because oxygen is toxic to them 1.12 Humus Ageing plant material is invaded by micro-organisms that begin to decompose it. At the same time, biochemical changes occur in that ageing material, breaking down cell membranes. Plant material eventually falls to the ground, is invaded by many soil organisms and decomposition quickens, as shown by increasing CO2 production. This leads to: immobilisation of elements by micro-organisms (i.e. micro-organisms use elements for growth) mineralisation of elements, making them available for plants synthesis of new compounds that form a dark brown to black shapeless material called humus This process of breaking down litter, releasing mineral nutrients and synthesising new compounds is humification. The biochemical changes that occur in organic matter in the soil during decomposition and humus formation are complex! White (pp. 48-49) mentions some. Two important features of humus are: humification produces organic colloids that have a high CEC the CEC of soil organic matter depends completely on pH the most important functional groups containing oxygen are those that dissociate to produce H+ ions and are the carboxylic and phenolic groups; carboxylic groups have a pK value between 3 and 5 and phenolic groups only release protons if pH &gt; 7 (Note: For an acid, HA + H2O \\(\\rightleftharpoons\\) H3O+ + A-, Ka = [H3O+][A-] / [HA] and pK = -log10K; e.g. for acetic acid, CH3COOH, Ka = 1.8 \\(\\times\\) 10-5 and pK = 4.74; for formic acid, HCOOH, Ka = 1.8 \\(\\times\\) 10-4 and pK = 3.74) humic compounds can form coordination complexes with metallic cations, producing a chelate compound; phenolic groups are involved in this (see figure below). 1.13 Peds and pores Notes below are based on White, pp. 72-74; Young and Young, pp 62-63. Bulk density = mass of oven-dry soil / total soil volume Volumetric water content = volume of water / total soil volume Air-filled porosity = volume of soil air / total soil volume Field capacity is water content at a suction of 10 kPa (Australian definition). See below also. Permanent wilting point is water content at a suction of 1,500 kPa. Available water capacity is the nominal amount of soil water that plants can use. The upper limit is the water content at field capacity and the lower limit is the water content at which plants can no longer extract water from the soil, lose turgor and wilt - i.e. permanent wilting point (turgor is the normal rigidity of plant cells caused by the pressure of the cell contents against the cell wall). The plant-available water capacity for a particular planted area or crop is the difference between the volumetric water content at field capacity and that at permanent wilting point (summed through the root zone). Note the above three values are a little arbitrary! Pore space ratio = volume of pores / total soil volume Note pore space ratio tells you nothing about the size distribution of the pores. In a soil with reasonable structure, pores can be classed as macropores or micropores. Macropores are the pores between soil aggregrates. They allow water to infiltrate and drain through the soil. Water can drain into and through them under the influence of gravity. Air also enters and moves through the soil in them; they are responsible for soil aeration. When the macropores are drained, the soil is at field capacity. Micropores are the pores inside soil aggregates. They are responsible for the storage of water and solutes. The water in these pores is held onto the soil particles by adhesion and surface tension, so a suction has to be applied to remove it. The water in micropores can be removed by evaporation and can be extracted by plants but does not drain out under the influence of gravity. With rain or irrigation, water infiltrates and wets the soil. The drainage rate often becomes very small 1 - 2 days after the rain or irrigation stops. The reason is that when most of the macropores have drained, there is a large drop in hydraulic conductivity. The water content at this point is usually taken as field capacity (although in Australia, field capacity is set at a suction of 10 kPa, which is around about this point). 1.14 Soil structure and aggregation Soil with a reasonable amount of clay in it forms aggregates: macroaggregates or peds - visible, usually from a few millimetres to a few centimetres in diameter, and are made up of groupings of microaggregates, which are made up of groupings of the primary particles, clay, silt and sand; bundles of clay particles attach themselves to the larger silt and sand particles or sometimes even surround them; the fundamental mechanism that gives microaggregates stability is clay particles binding together Roots contribute to soil structure: roots travel around and through aggregates, creating a three-dimensional “mesh” in the soil roots exert pressure on aggregates, compressing and separating them roots take up water from the soil, causing localised dryness, shrinkage and cracking of soil in the root zone roots and root hairs grow and die, promoting microbial activity and this results in “humic cements” being produced these cements are often broken down in turn by microbes, so organic matter has to be constantly supplied to the soil to maintain the stability of the aggregates If the soil surface has no protective cover and is left exposed (e.g. after harvesting annual crops), the topsoil will dry out, resulting in desiccation: if it is then cultivated, the dried aggregates can be reduced to dust if it rains on the dry aggregates, they may slake If the soil is cultivated when it is very wet, the churning effect of cultivation causes compaction. Humus is accululated best and soil aggregates stabilised most effectively under perennial vegetation. Microbes contribute to soil structure: microbial activity varies over time as does the mix of microbes, which include protozoa (one-celled organisms with a true nucleus containing DNA - eukaryotes), bacteria (one-celled organisms without a true nucleus, where DNA is contained in the cytoplasm - prokaryotes), fungi and actinomycetes (bacteria that can break down more resistant carbon compounds like lignin) bacteria living in the rhizosphere are particularly important fungi are also particularly important, as they produce extensive networks of hyphae (or mycelia) soil microbes bind aggregates by adsorption, physical entangling the particles and excreting viscous material that acts like a glue microbial excretions (organic polymers): can be adsorbed onto clay surfaces can penetrate between individual clay particles can form a protective coating around soil aggregates can dissolve in the soil solution, penetrate aggregates and then precipitate in the aggregate forming an internal cement Some inorganic substances can also act like a cement: calcium carbonate and iron and aluminium oxides can contribute a lot to aggregate stability (in soils without much organic matter - e.g. tropical soils - these substances can provide considerable stability) 1.15 Stability 1.15.1 Slaking Putting a ped into water results in the water infiltrating the ped. The infiltrating water will increase the pressure of the air in the pores in the ped. If the air bubbles out and the ped remains intact, it is stable. If the ped breaks up, it has “slaked”. This means it does not have enough material to hold it together strongly enough to withstand the increased air pressure. 1.15.2 Dispersion If the ped, after putting it into water, produces cloudiness in the water, it has “dispersed”. This is the result of the clay particles in the ped becoming separated from one another (deflocculation). It shows that the clay layers in the particles were initially bound together by sodium ions. Sodium ions are large ions with a single charge, Na+, and are in the clay interlayer spaces. Water molecules can move into the interlayer spaces, attracted by the sodium ions, and hydrate those ions. This increases the space between the clay layers to such an extent that the layers separate and the clay particle disintegrates. This causes the cloudiness around the ped. Such a soil is “sodic”. Calcium ions, Ca2+, are smaller and hold the clay layers together more strongly than sodium. Water cannot move into the interlayer space if calcium ions are binding the layers together. Water molecules can only move to the edge of the particles under any attraction by the calcium ions but do not break the calcium-clay bonds. Organic matter, iron and aluminium sesquioxides and cations, especially calcium and magnesium, encourage flocculation (i.e. bind clay layers together). 1.16 Soil acidity and pH Most of the stuff below comes from Sparks, Environmental Soil Chemistry, chapter 9. 1.16.1 Various introductory comments Soil acidity affects the availability of: nutrients macronutrients are more available above a pH of about 5.5 micronutrients are more available below a pH of about 6 bacteria and actinomycetes like a pH above about 5.5 fungi don’t really care about pH (4 &lt; pH &lt; 9), as long as it’s not extreme In most soils, soil acidity is related to H and Al. The latter is more important except when pH &lt; 4. At low pH, Al, Fe and Mn - and heavy metals - become more soluble and can be toxic to plants. As pH increases, they become less soluble and start to precipitate. 1.16.2 Acid sulphate soils - a little aside Acid sulphate soils occur on marine floodplains in temperate and tropical climates. When these floodplains are drained, pyrite in the soil is oxidised and high levels of acidity produced. Disulphide (S22-) is oxidised by ferric iron (Fe3+) to produce sulphate (SO42-), ferrous iron (Fe2+) and protons. This is Sparks’ equation (p. 270):        FeS2 + 15/4 O2 + 7/2 H2O \\(\\rightarrow\\) Fe(OH)3 + 2H2SO4 Essington gives his version, including the half reactions (p. 446):        FeS2(s) + 8H2O(l) \\(\\rightarrow\\) Fe2+(aq) + 2SO42-(aq) + 16H+(aq) + 14e-        14Fe3+(aq) + 14e- \\(\\rightarrow\\) 14Fe2+(aq), with the overall reaction        FeS2(s) + 14Fe3+(aq) + 8H2O(l) \\(\\rightarrow\\) 15Fe2+(aq) + 2SO42-(aq) + 16H+(aq) Here, Fe3+ is the oxidant and S2- is the reductant. (Another aside: The pyrite structure also occurs in other MX2 compounds, where M is a transition metal and X is a member of the oxygen group (O, S, Se and Te).) 1.16.3 Al and soil acidity Al hydrolyses in an aqueous solution - this reaction is reversible. (Hydrolysis is a reaction where a substance is split or decomposed by water.) There’s a set of reactions “starting” with [Al(H2O)6]3+ and “ending” with [Al(OH)4(H2O)2]1-. The product of each hydrolysis reaction is a monomeric Al ion and H3O+. At each “step”, one molecule of water is deprotonated. The start is        [Al(H2O)6]3+ + H2O \\(\\rightleftharpoons\\) [Al(OH)(H2O)5]2+ + H3O+ and it just goes on from there. See below. Figure 1.4: Sparks, p. 271 Two points are noteworthy: the amount the pH drops as these reactions occur depends on the concentration of Al in the soil solution; the relative concentrations of the various Al ions depend on the pH of the soil solution: if pH &lt; 4.7 or pH &gt; 7.5, the concentration of Al3+ quickly increases. If 4.7 &lt; pH &lt; 7.5, the solubility of Al is low and it precipitates as Al(OH)3. Figure 1.5: Sparks, Fig. 9.2, p. 272 Free Al3+ might only account for a small proportion of Al in the soil solution. There may be quite a lot bound to fluoride or sulphate ions, humic material or organic acids. As pH increases, the amount of Al3+ decreases and various monomeric (one Al atom) and polymeric (more than one Al atom) hydroxy-Al species become more common. These latter species can occur in the interlayers of smectite and vermiculite, in organic complexes and oxyhydroxide coatings on clay particles. These hydroxy-Al species are non-exchangeable (because they cannot be replaced or extracted by a salt like KCl). The polymers are large and positive and are more likely to be in interlayer spaces than monomeric species. If these polymeric species are arranged around the edge of the interlayer space, they can block other ions reaching exchange sites further into the interlayer space. If they are arranged throughout the interlayer space, they act as props, keeping the interlayer space open, and increase ion exchange. 1.16.4 Soil acidity - some (more) detail The main forms of acidity in mineral soils relate to Al; the two main forms are exchangeable (or extractable, since the technique used can affect the result) and nonexchangeable. Exchangeable acidity is the amount of total CEC due to H+, contributing the smaller component) and Al3+, the larger component. The amount of exchangeable acidity depends on the soil type, and so the amount of CEC due to exchangeable bases (i.e. Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ and Na+). The proportion of exchangeable acidity out of total acidity decreases in this order: montmorillonite - it has mostly constant charge sites dioctahedral vermiculites - a substantial amount of their acidity is nonexchangeable and made up of polymeric hydroxy-Al material in the interlayer space and depends on pH kaolin minerals - it has low CEC and variable charge Al and Fe coatings on clay particles reduce the amount of exchangeable acidity that can be extracted and so reduce the proportion of exchangeable acidity in the total acidity. 1.16.5 Acidity and weathering Essington, pp. 473ff Soil acidification is a natural result of weathering. During weathering, carbonic and organic acids hydrolyse soil minerals. Base cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+) and silica become soluble (are “solubilised”). Other products of weathering, such as soluble Al3+ and Fe3+, hydrolyse, producing protons in the process and also, on the Al side, mainly AlOH2+ and Al(OH)2+. Al species (Al3+, AlOH2+ and Al(OH)2+) then displace base cations from the exchange complex. In areas where rainfall exceeds evapotranspiration, base cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+), which do not hydrolyse to produce protons, are leached from the soil. The fundamental cause of soil acidity is Al species occupying the exchange complex. These Al species are labile (i.e. they can be removed from the exchange complex easily and hydrolysed, producing protons). Many soils across the world, such as soils in the humid tropics and in forests in temperate zones, are acidic. 1.16.6 Acidity and biological processes See Essington, Soil and Water Chemistry, chapter 10. {p. 482} Most oxidation reactions produce protons. Most reduction reactions consume protons. Curious! Systems with lots of electrons are reduced (here hydrogen will be more stable relative to water) and those depleted of electrons are oxidised (here, oxygen will be more stable relative to water) (Essington, pp. 445 &amp; 447). You need to look at the whole redox reaction to see what’s happening - oxidation or reduction half-reactions on their own don’t show the full picture. Example Oxidising ammonium can potentially lead to acidification through nitrification:        NH4+ (aq) + 2O2(g) \\(\\rightarrow\\) NO3-(aq) + 2H+(aq) + H2O(l) Nitrification will only lead to acidification if the nitrate and base cations are leached from the soil. If this leaching happens, the protons produced by nitrification will stay in the soil. They will occupy organic exchange sites and also take part in mineral weathering. The Al dissolved in this weathering will hydrolyse, producing more acidity and also displace base cations from exchange sites. If the nitrate is not leached, acidification may not occur. This is because, when plants absorb a nutrient anion, they release OH- and HCO3-, generating alkalinity:        [equivalents anions absorbed] - [equivalents cations absorbed] = [equivalents hydroxide            and hydrogen carbonate released] Similarly, when plant roots absorb cations, acidity is generated:        [equivalents cations absorbed] - [equivalents anions absorbed] = [equivalents protons released] Plants usually absorb more cations than anions, so, on the whole, more protons are released than hydroxide and hydrogen carbonate. The pH of the rhizosphere can be up to two units lower than the soil solution. 1.16.7 Neutralising soil acidity, liming … Sparks, pp. 281-282 To neutralise soil acidity, apply lime. The general reaction is:        CaCO3 + H2O \\(\\rightarrow\\) Ca2+ + HCO3- + OH- The hydroxide reacts with existing H+ or H+ formed by hydrolysing Al3+:        2 Al-soil + 3CaCO3 + 3H2O \\(\\rightarrow\\) 3 Ca-soil + 2Al(OH)3 (\\(\\downarrow\\)) + 3CO2 The products are Ca2+, which can move onto exchange sites, and Al(OH)3, which precipitates, removing Al from exchange sites and the soil solution (more on this from Essington below). Essington, s. 10.3 &amp; 10.4, pp. 483ff. Revisiting soil acidity. If less H+ is neutralised than is produced by acid-forming processes, soil becomes acidic. Some of these neutralising processes are: mineral weathering plants taking up anions anions or surface functional groups being protonated base cations being retained on exchange sites reduction reactions Definitions Acid-neutralisation capacity of the soil solid phase (ANC) When K-feldspar, for example, is weathered by hydrolysis (i.e. dissolved), protons are consumed. This reduces the ANC of the soil solids by using up minerals (i.e. K-feldspar) that can neutralise protons. When Al3+ is hydrolysed, gibbsite (Al(OH)3) is precipitated and protons are produced. This increases the ANC of the soil solids by producing a mineral that can neutralise protons (i.e. the reaction could go the other way, if conditions were right). The soil exchange complex responds quickly to any change in the soil solution. The ANC of the soil solids exchange complex (soil exchange phase ANC) is the amount of surface charge on the exchange complex that equals the charge of the exchangeable bases adsorbed on the complex. These exchangeable bases are the metals that do not hydrolyse at usual soil pH (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+). The ANC of the soil exchange pahse is also called “base saturation”. So, … Total acidity Total acidity of a soil = CEC - ANC (i.e. the part of the CEC not occupied by exchangeabe base cations) Actual total acidity is also called exchangeable acidity. (There is also non-exchangeable acidity. This is made up of Al species and protons that are bound onto surfaces but that cannot be displaced. This is not part of total acidity.) It’s mainly made up of Al3+ and Al(OH)2+ on clay exchange sites Al species and protons that are in complexes with organic functional groups Back to neutralising soil acidity … The point at which soil acidity needs to be reduced for optimal plant growth is not based on pH but on total acidity. Well, …! When total acidity reaches more than about 15 % of CEC, soil acidity needs to be reduced. To reduce acidity to an appropriate level, base cations need to be added to remove acidic species from the exchange complex. Usually, Ca2+ or Mg2+ is added. The lime requirement is based on the amount of these base cations needed to reduce total acidity and is not based on the pH. Tests used to work out how much base cation is needed are built on buffer tests incorporating measured changes in pH values and give approximate values. The liming materials usually used are limestone (CaCO3) and dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2). Adding CaCO3 initially consumes protons but the overall soil neutralisation reaction conserves protons. The aims of liming are to: displacing Al species from the exchange phase by base cations precipitate the Al that has been displaced The reactions go like this:        3CaCO3(s) + 6H+(aq) \\(\\rightarrow\\) 3Ca2+(aq) + 3CO2(g) + 3H2O(l) This first reaction quickly increases the pH of the soil solution. This increased pH promotes Ca2+ moving onto exchange sites:        3Ca2+(aq) + 2AlX3(ex) \\(\\rightarrow\\) 3CaX2(ex) + 2Al3+(aq) The raised pH also promotes Al precipitating:        2Al3+(aq) + 3H2O(l) \\(\\rightarrow\\) 2Al(OH)3(s) + 6H+(aq) Adding the three equations above together gives the overall reaction equation:        3CaCO3(s) + 2AlX3(ex) + 3H2O(l) \\(\\rightarrow\\) 3CaX2(ex) + 2Al(OH)3(s) + 3CO2(g) Note that there is no net decrease in H+ ions.

This system uses two superkingdoms, Prokaryota and Eukaryota, and seven kingdoms. No more explanatory notes about it yet! 2.2 Plant classification Plants can be classified in more than one way. The method you choose depends on what differences you want to highlight. One method divides plants into those with vascular tissue and those with non-vascular tissue. Vascular tissue transports water and nutrients up the roots and stems. The diagram below is simplified and does not include all plant groups. As it is based on whether vascular tissue is present, it highlights the evolution of water independence in plants. Non-vascular plants (e.g. mosses) need to live in or near a moist environment. Vascular plants (e.g. ferns and seed-bearing plants), on the other hand, can live in drier environments as they can obtain water through their roots. Dividing plants into spore-bearing and seed-bearing plants focusses on the ways in which plants reproduce. Gymnosperms and angiosperms bear seeds, while all other plants reproduce via spores. Seeds gave plants a better chance of survival. (Reference: https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/Book%3A_Introductory_Biology_(CK-12)/09%3A_Plants/9.06%3A_Plant_Classification) Ferns are the class Filicinae. Gymnosperms are a class and include the orders Conifers, Cycads and Gingko. They produce seeds in cones and do not flower. Angiosperms are a class and are divided into the sub-classes Monocots (or Liliopsida) (e.g. palms, grasses) and Dicots (or Magnoliopsida) (e.g. flowering trees, shrubs and climbers) and produce seeds in flowers. Under Kingdom, the next taxonomic rank is division (in botany) and phylum (in zoology). 2.2.1 Suffixes in taxonomic ranks in botany (See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank) Division: -ophyta Class: -opsida Subclass: -idae Order: -ales Family: -aceae Subfamily: -oideae 2.3 Primary and secondary growth Primary growth results from cell division in the tips of the stem and roots and results in the stems and roots lengthening. Secondary growth results from cell division in the cambium, producing xylem on the inside and phloem on the outside and so causing the stem to thicken. Secondary growth occurs in dicots and gymnosperms but not usually in monocots. Monocots may have “anomalous secondary growth”. Palms, for example, increase their stem diameter by parenchyma cells dividing and enlarging, a process where no secondary xylem or phloem is formed (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_growth). Parenchyma cells are a type of ground tissue, which is tissue that is not on the external surface of plants or part of vascular tissue. It’s a type of “filler” tissue in the soft parts of plants (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_tissue). There are different types of anomalous secondary growth in other monocots. 2.4 Plant characteristics When talking about the type and life form of a plant, move from left to right through the characteristics below.

Habit include stem characteristics Leaf arrangement shape size margin type texture and surfaces colour scent Flowers inflorescence type position flower shape size colour scent season 2.5 Plant tissues Note: References are from Raven et al., The Biology of Plants After the embryo has formed, new plant cells are produced by the meristems. Meristems are tissues (i.e. tissues are groups of cells that are similar and perform specific functions) where cells that are undifferentiated undergo cell division by mitosis. There are two main types of meristem (Raven, p. 6): apical meristem - are at tips of shoots and roots and are involved with extension growth of the plant (i.e. often vertical growth) - this type of growth is primary growth lateral meristem - this consists of the vascular cambium and cork cambium, which are involved with increasing the thickness or girth of stems, branches and roots - this type of growth is secondary growth In both apical and lateral meristems, some cells can repeatedly divide; one of the cells produced stays in the meristem (“initial”), the other eventually becomes a new plant body cell (“derivative) - these two new cells are not different from each other, but take on their roles from their position in the meristem (Raven, p. 453). There are three types of primary meristem: protoderm - produces the future epidermis, a single layer of cells forming the outermost layer of the stem ground meristem - produces the ground tissue (mostly parenchyma cells), which in a stem, surrounds the vascular tissue procambium - produces the vascular tissue (i.e. xylem and phloem) These three tissues are primary meristems because (Raven, p. 454): they produce primary tissues many of their cells can divide and remain undifferentiated for some time (i.e. they can divide again) before they differentiate into specific types of cell 2.5.1 Primary growth The shoot develops to a certain stage in the embryo and consists of a plumule (the stem), leaf primordia (rudimentary leaves) and an apical meristem. During germination, new seed leaves develop from the apical meristem and the stem lengthens, forming nodes and internodes, and bud primordia form in leaf axils. The growing terminal bud often inhibits the lateral buds from growing - this is apical dominance. As the distance between the shoot tip and the lateral buds increases, the terminal bud exerts progressively less influence on the lateral buds and they grow more (Raven, p. 488). 2.5.2 Xylem See Raven, p. 453 Xylem is the main type of plant tissue that conducts water and minerals in vascular plants. It’s made up of two types of cell, tracheids and vessel elements (or vessel members). There are two types of xylem: primary xylem - produced by the inner cells of the procambium (Raven, p. 492) secondary xylem - produced by the vascular cambium During primary growth, primary xylem cells may be stretched, although many are destroyed during elongation. 2.5.3 Phloem See Raven, p. 453 Phloem is the main type of plant tissue that transports food. The main types of phloem cells are sieve cells and sieve-tube members. There are two types of phloem: primary phloem - produced by the outer cells of the procambium (Raven, p. 492) secondary phloem - produced by the vascular cambium During primary growth, primary phloem cells are often stretched and destroyed during elongation. 2.5.4 Secondary growth 2.5.5 Vascular cambium See Raven, p. 521-522 The vascular cambium is a single layer of cells between the primary xylem and primary phloem that stays meristematic. Secondary phloem and secondary xylem are produced by periclinal divisions of the cambial initials and their derivatives. After periclinal division of vascular cambial initials, those derivatives that are on the inside become xylem cells, while those on the outside become phloem cells. Xylem and phloem cells produced from fusiform initials have their long axis orientated vertically and make up the axial system of secondary vascular tissue. Cells produced from ray initials are called ray cells and are orientated horizontally. They form the vascular rays or radial system. Vascular rays: move food from secondary phloem to secondary xylem move water from secondary xylem to secondary phloem store start, protein and lipids As the vascular cambium produces more and more secondary xylem cells, the width of the xylem cell region increases and the cambium is pushed outwards. The circumference of the vascular cambium increases to allow this by anticlinal division of initials. 2.5.6 Growth rings See Raven, p. 535 The activity of the vascular cambium changes with the seasons in temperate climatic zones. This produces growth rings in the secondary xylem and secondary phloem. If a growth layer represents growth over one year, it’s an annual ring. The width of an individual growth ring depends on environmental factors: light temperature rainfall available soil water length of growing season In semi-arid areas, the growth rings of a tree give a very good picture of the relative amount of rain that has fallen. Figure 2.1: Raven, Fig. 24-4, p. 522 Figure 2.1 caption: Periclinal and anticlinal divisions of fusiform initials (vertically elongated cells). (a) Periclinal divisions are involved in forming secondary phloem and secondary xylem cells and result in the formation of radial rows of cells (see Fig. 24-5 below). When an initial divides periclinally, two cells appear, one behind (or in front of) the other. (b) Anticlinal divisions are involved in the multiplication of fusiform initials. When an initial divides anticlinally, two cells appear side by side. Figure 2.2: Raven, Fig. 24-5, p. 522. Figure 2.2 caption: Diagram showing the relationship of the vascular cambium to its derivative tissues - secondary xylem and secondary phloem. The darker cells are the more recently derived ones. The vascular cambium is made up of two types of cell - fusiform initials (vertically elongated cells) and ray initials (horizontally elongated cells) - which give rise to the axial and radial systems, respectively, of the secondary vascular tissues. When the cambial initials produce secondary xylem and secondary phloem, they divide periclinally. Following division of an initial, one daughter cell (the initial) remains meristematic, and the other (the derivative of the initial) eventually develops into one or more cells of the vascular tissue. Cells produced toward the inner surface of the vascular cambium become xylem elements and those produced toward the outer surface become phloem elements. The ray initials divide to form vascular rays, which lie at right angles to the derivatives of the fusiform initials. With the production of additional secondary xylem, the vascular cambium and secondary phloem are displaced outwards. The diagrams (left to right) represent successively more mature stages. 2.6 Reaction wood See Raven, p. 538 Reaction wood is abnormal wood that develops in trunks or branches that are leaning.

The qualities of growing media must match the growth phase of the plants: seed germination / rooting cuttings, potting up, potting on. 3.6.1 Seed propagation free from pests and disease high water-holding capacity to maintain uniform moisture around seeds 3.6.2 Cuttings free from pests and disease very porous good drainage, as cuttings are often misted and so the growing medium must not become waterlogged high aeration or air-filled porosity (i.e. a high percentage of macropores) to encourage root growth 3.6.3 Transplant or potting on media Plants in this growth phase have actively growing roots, shoots and leaves, can support themselves, absorb nutrients and produce their own food. free from pests and disease coarser than seed propagation or cuttings media well-aerated and drained (i.e. holding more air (oxygen)) good water-holding and nutrient holding capacity to satisfy the needs of actively growing plants (i.e. actively growing roots, shoots and leaves) initially, water-holding capacity is less than seed raising and tubing up mixes but increases as organic components decompose heavy enough so plants stay upright (i.e. more sand) may contain some fertiliser N.B. The type of potting mix used for potting on depends on the type of plant, the conditions (e.g. more protected or less protected) it will grow under, season and irrigation method. Potting on mixes can be general or made to suit the needs of particular plants (e.g. orchids, azaleas). 3.6.4 Establishment media In this growth phase, plants have well-developed root and shoot systems and can support themselves, absorb nutrients and produce and store their own food. They need to be able to cope with an environment with few climatic controls. The emphasis here is on keeping the plant healthy and not encouraging it to grow excessively. free from pests and disease lower aeration and drainage than other mixes to allow for slower growth rates and less maintenance high water-holding and nutrient-holding capacity (due to less maintenance) ballast (i.e. more sand) for stability for plants remaining in containers for the long-term, the media must resist decomposing - the particles must remain stable to maintain growing conditions; sand can be used to provide the smallest particles "],["weeds.html", "4 Weeds 4.1 Weeding techniques", " 4 Weeds 4.1 Weeding techniques 4.1.1 Crowning The crown is the part of the plant that sits just below the surface of the soil.

For example, labile phosphate is that proportion soil phosphate that can be easily converted into plant-available - or soluble - phosphate. The labile pool of a nutrient is the ions of that nutrient which are held on the exchange complex in the solid phase of the soil and which can replace the same ions in the soil solution, as those soluble ions are lost (e.g. by plant uptake, leaching). mineralisation When plant material decomposes, elements that were part of organic compounds in the plant material are converted to inorganic forms in a process called mineralisation. Some of these elements are used by micro-organisms for growth (immobilisation of elements) and what is left over (if anything) is mineralised. For example, N, P and S end up as NH4+, H2PO4- and SO42- ions and about half the C is released as CO2.
