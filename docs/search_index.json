The method you choose depends on what differences you want to highlight. One method divides plants into those with vascular tissue and those with non-vascular tissue. Vascular tissue transports water and nutrients up the roots and stems. The diagram below is simplified and does not include all plant groups. As it is based on whether vascular tissue is present, it highlights the evolution of water independence in plants. Non-vascular plants (e.g. mosses) need to live in or near a moist environment. Vascular plants (e.g. ferns and seed-bearing plants), on the other hand, can live in drier environments as they can obtain water through their roots. Dividing plants into spore-bearing and seed-bearing plants focusses on the ways in which plants reproduce. Gymnosperms and angiosperms bear seeds, while all other plants reproduce via spores. Seeds gave plants a better chance of survival. (Reference: https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/Book%3A_Introductory_Biology_(CK-12)/09%3A_Plants/9.06%3A_Plant_Classification) Ferns are the class Filicinae. Gymnosperms are a class and include the orders Conifers, Cycads and Gingko. They produce seeds in cones and do not flower. Angiosperms are a class and are divided into the sub-classes Monocots (or Liliopsida) (e.g. palms, grasses) and Dicots (or Magnoliopsida) (e.g. flowering trees, shrubs and climbers) and produce seeds in flowers. Under Kingdom, the next taxonomic rank is division (in botany) and phylum (in zoology). 2.1.1 Suffixes in taxonomic ranks in botany (See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank) Division: -ophyta Class: -opsida Subclass: -idae Order: -ales Family: -aceae Subfamily: -oideae "],["growing-media.html", "3 Growing media 3.1 Functions of growing media 3.2 Physical properties of growing media 3.3 Growing media for particular purposes", " 3 Growing media A growing medium is a material through which plant roots grow and from which they extract water and nutrients. 3.1 Functions of growing media physical support growing medium must support the plant or cutting but stay porous large plants need ballast in the medium to hold plant upright aeration plant roots need oxygen so they can convert sugar into energy to grow this process produces carbon dioxide, which needs to be removed from the root zone to prevent toxic concentrations building up this gas exchange occurs in the macropores water supply growing media hold water in the micropores they need enough porosity to store the required amounts of water organic material is one of the main components of growing media that absorb and hold water nutrient supply most nutrients are obtained by a plant through its roots from the potting medium most nutrients are cations the potting medium must contain materials which can hold these cations the capacity of a material to hold cations is cation exchange capacity (CEC) potting media components can vary widely in CEC 3.2 Physical properties of growing media water-holding capacity this is the percentage of total pore space that stays filled with water after letting water drain under gravity a growing medium needs good water holding capacity and good drainage it has good drainage if it has enough macropores to let water drain away and prevent waterlogging compaction is important to take into account - if the medium is compacted, the proportion of macropores is reduced and the roots will be deprived of oxygen aeration the percentage of pore space that is filled with air after excess water has drained away is aeration oxygen is supplied to and carbon dioxide is removed from the root zone through the macropores a good growing medium needs a high percentage of macropores porosity total porosity is the sum of the volume of macropores and the volume of micropores - plants need both adequate macropores and micropores a medium with mainly larger particles will have higher aeration and lower water-holding capacity than a medium with mainly smaller particles, which will have lower aeration and higher water-holding capacity - neither is probably satisfactory 3.3 Growing media for particular purposes 3.3.1 Root cuttings a high percentage of macropores (i.e. high aeration) is needed "],["resources.html", "4 Resources", " 4 Resources NSW Department of Primary Industries has lots of useful things.
