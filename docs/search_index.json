Soil and Water Chemistry: An Integrative Approach, CRC Press, Chapter 2. 1.1 Soil mineralogy - introductory ideas Minerals in soils can be crystalline - these are naturally occurring inorganic compounds with atoms in a 3-D structure that repeats amorphous - these are naturally occurring inorganic compounds with no repeating structure The O2- anion is the dominant anion in soil minerals (47% by weight). The coordination number is the number of anions that can be packed around a cation with no overlap. The bigger the cation, the more anions that can fit around it. The figure below from Essington shows how charges of bonds are counted. First, a definition: bond strength = cation valence / coordination number. On the left are silicon tetrahedra, with the Si4+ ions in tetrahedral coordination, each surrounded by four O2- ions. The strength of each Si-O bond is +4 / 4 = +1. The tetrahedra are bonded through a shared basal corner O2- ion. The 2- charge on the O ion is exactly balanced by the 1+ charge on each of the two Si ions it’s bonded to. On the right hand side are Al3+ ions in octahedral coordination, each surrounded by six OH- ions. The strength of each Al-OH bond is +3 / 6 = +1/2. Consequently, each OH- ion can only be bonded by two Al3+ ions. The -2 charge on each O2- ion is exactly balanced by its bond with two Al3+ ions and one H+ ion. Figure 1.1: Essington, Fig. 2.5, p. 41 A unit cell of a crystal is the smallest three-dimensional repeating unit of atoms. The most commonly occurring minerals in soil are the silicates. One class of silicates, the phyllosilicates or clay minerals, has a substantial effect on the physical and chemical properties of soil. The primary silicate minerals formed as liquid magma cooled and make up the bulk of the sand- and silt-sized fractions of soil. The secondary silicate minerals, formed from the weathering of the primary silicates or from precipitation of soluble mineral material, are found mainly in the clay fraction of soil and are responsible for many chemical reactions in soils. 1.2 Climate 1.2.1 Moisture In moist or humid climates, water moves downwards, on balance, for most of the year. This leads to leaching of soluble minerals and translocation downwards of clay particles. In arid climates, water moves upwards, on balance, over the year. This leads to salts being brought up the soil profile and closer to the surface. 1.2.2 Temperature Temperature affects the rate of mineral weathering and formation and biological processes, such as growth and decomposition. 1.3 Parent material Rocks are classified as igneous, sedimentary or metamorphic. Notes below are based on: https://australian.museum/learn/minerals/shaping-earth/classification-of-igneous-rocks/ 1.3.1 Igneous rocks these are formed by the solidification of molten magma in the Earth’s crust or on the surface of the Earth’s crust they are divided into classes based on grain size and silica content: grain size volcanic rocks - they solidify close to the Earth’s surface and so cool quickly; they have finer grains plutonic rocks - they solidify deep in the Earth’s crust and cool slowly; they have coarse grains silica content acidic - rocks with more than 63% silica (mostly light-coloured K/Na feldspars and quartz); mainly instrusive (i.e. forming within the crust) - e.g. granite basic - rocks with 45% to 55% quartz but high in dark-coloured ferromagnesian minerals (i.e. Fe and Mg) and Ca feldspars; mainly extrusive (i.e. forming on Earth’s surface from lava) - e.g. basalt 1.3.2 Metamorphic rocks Igneous and sedimentary rocks that are subjected to high temperature and pressure have their mineral composition and structure changed and are transformed into metamorphic rocks. Under high temperature and pressure, existing minerals break down and form new minerals. Particular pressure/temperature conditions cause particular index minerals to form and these minerals can be used as one classifying feature of metamorphic rocks. Apart from index minerals, other classifying features are grain size and degree of foliation. Texture: foliated (leaf-like layers) - newly formed minerals align themselves perpendicular to the direction of stress; metamorphic rocks break easily along foliation planes non-foliated, massive or granular - a granular texture develops if a rock’s chemical composition is similar to that of a particular mineral (e.g. marble - see below) As the grade of metamorphism increases (i.e. higher pressure and temperature), crystal size increases and foliation becomes coarser (e.g. in limestone, calcite recrystallises into larger crystals and forms marble). Grain size Foliation Fine Coarse Poor Hornfels Marble, quartzite Good Slate Gneiss 1.3.3 Sedimentary rocks These are composed of the products of the weathering of igneous and metamorphic rocks and are formed when these products are deposited by wind or water. As more and more sediment layers are laid down, they exert weight on deeper sediments, which harden and form rock. Some sedimentary rocks form by precipitation of minerals, such as limestone. 1.4 Chain silicates In the figure below, silicon tetrahedra are shwon linked into single chains (top) and double chains (bottom). Pyroxenes are made up of single chains of silicon tetrahedra linked through basal oxygen atoms. The basic unit is SiO32-. How do you get this unit formula? Each Si-O bond has a strength of +4 / 4 = +1. The four O atoms in a single tetrahedron in focus are numbered. O no. 1 is shared with the neighbouring Si atom, so only half of it “belongs to” the tetrahedron in question. O nos. 2 and 3 both belong wholly to the focal tetrahedron. Like O no. 1, only half of O no. 4 is counted. So, there are one Si atom and three O atoms in the basic pyroxene unit, giving SiO32-. Amphiboles are made up of double chains of silicon tetrahedra linked through basal oxygen atoms. The basic unit is Si4O112-. How so? The Si atoms are numbered 1 to 4. The set of tetrahedra with these Si atoms constitutes the basic repeating unit of the chains. Some of the oxygen atoms in this unit are marked in groups (with A, B and C), while the other six O atoms in the repeating unit are unmarked. Again, each Si-O bond has a strength of +1. The six unmarked O atoms in the unit belong wholly to the unit and contribute their full value. Contribution here is 6. O atoms marked A are shared with Si atoms in neighbouring tetrahedra, so each contributes half to the basic unit. Contribution here is 2. One of the O atoms marked B is shared between Si atoms 1 and 2 (i.e. half with each Si atom), both of which are in the basic unit, so that O atom contributes its full worth. The other O atom marked B is shared in the same way with Si atoms 3 and 4 and also contributes its full worth. Contribution here is 2. Oxygen atom C is shared in a similar way to the Bs, so also contributes its full worth. Contribution here is 1. Total oxygen “value” is 11. This gives the basic unit of Si4O112-. Figure 1.2: Essington, Fig. 2.10, p. 49 1.5 Phyllosilicates Phyllosilicates are sheet silicates or layer silicates. The basic unit is Si2O52-. Each individual tetrahedron shares three basal O atoms, as shown below. The result is a sheet structure. Figure 1.3: Essington, Fig. 2.11, p. 50 An example of primary phyllosilicate minerals is the micas. They are 2:1 layer silicates - i.e. two silicate tetrahedral sheets sandwiching an octahedral sheet. The basic unit of the octahedral sheets is three octahedra. If two out of the three positions available in the octahedra for cations are occupied by cations, the sheet is dioctahedral. If all three positions are occupied, the sheet is trioctahedral. Isomorphous substitution occurs when an atom replaces another atom which has a similar size - e.g. Al3+ can replace Si4+ in a tetrahedral sheet and Fe2+, Fe3+ or Mg2+ can replace Al3+ in octahedral sheets. If Al3+ substitutes for Si4+ in a tetrahedral layer in a dioctahedral mica, there will be a charge deficit of -1. This is balanced by K+ ions in the interlayer space. In trioctahedral micas, the three octahedral spaces are occupied by divalent cations (e.g. Mg2+) to maintain the charge balance. If Al3+ substitutes for Si4+ in a tetrahedral layer in a trioctahedral mica, there will be a charge deficit of -1. This is balanced by K+ ions in the interlayer space, as in the dioctahedral case. 1.6 Clay mineralogy Clay minerals or clay material is made up of: phyllosilicates, of which there are three types, based on the ratio of tetrahedral to octahedral sheets 1:1 2:1 interlayered 1:1, 2:1 and octahedra accessory minerals - i.e. metal oxides, hydroxides and oxyhydroxides and organic matter. 1.6.1 1:1 phyllosilicates Dioctahedral: kaolinite group Kaolinite is probably the most common aluminosilicate mineral in soil. Its 1:1 layers are held together quite tightly by hydrogen bonding. It has low CEC (it has a little isomorphous substitution and also has some edge charge due to protonation and deprotonation). Trioctahedral: serpentine group 1.6.2 2:1 phyllosilicates These minerals are can be grouped according to layer charge. The mica group, which consists of primary minerals, has a layer charge of about 0.6 to 2, due to isomorphous substitution (note that vermiculite is a secondary mineral derived from mica). The smectite group has a layer charge of up to about 0.6 and includes both dioctahedral and trioctahedral minerals. As the layer charge of smectites is fairly low, water molecules and hydrated cations can get between the 2:1 layers. The hydrated cations in the interlayer space that satisfy the charge can be displaced and are exchangeable. The vermiculite group has a charge between about 0.6 and 0.9. Even though the layer charge is higher than the smectites, water and hydrated cations can still get between the 2:1 layers. 1.6.3 Interlayered 1:1, 2:1 and octahedra This group includes, for example, the chlorite group, which is interlayered octahedral. 1.7 Accessory minerals These are mainly various oxides of Al, FeIII, Mn and Si. They are amphoteric - i.e. they can carry positive or negative charge depending on the characteristics of the soil solution. Gibbsite, Al(OH)3, is a ubiquitous metal hydroxide, occurring particularly in highly weathered soils. Compounds of iron are also very common, with goethite, FeOOH, the most common hydrous iron oxide. Iron oxides accumulate in highly weathered soils, especially those that form from the weathering of basic rocks. All the iron oxides form by precipitation. Haematite, an FeIII oxide, Fe2O3, often occurs with goethite. 1.8 Surface charge - and CEC Cations (and anions) are adsorbed onto the surfaces of clay minerals and oxides owing to: permanent negative charge on clay minerals due to isomorphous substitution the amphoteric properties (i.e. can be negatively or positively charged) of the edges of kaolinite and the oxides and oxyhydroxides of Fe and Al. The cation (or anion) charge adsorbed gives the cation exchange capacity (or CEC) of the mineral. Analogously, there is also the anion exchange capacity (AEC). For crystalline 1:1 and 2:1 phyllosilicates, permanent negative charge and so CEC is more important. Note CEC varies quite a lot within mineral groups. In 2:1 clays, illites, for example, have a low CEC, as a lot of the charge is neutralised by interlayer K+, which is non-exchangeable. In vermiculites, however, the interlayer Ca2+ and Mg2+ are exchangeable and so the CEC is high. In sesquioxides, the charge depends on pH. Sesquioxides are positively charged up to a pH of 8 and so contribute nothing to CEC. 1.9 Soil organic matter About 20% to 40% of what a plant produces through photosynthesis in a growing season is returned to the soil. Plant cells are made up mostly of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Of the carbohydrates, sugars and starch are decomposed quickly, while celluose is less easily decomposed. Proteins are quickly decomposed ultimately into amino acids. Some of the amino acids are used by micro-organisms for growth. Whether there is any surplus amino-N that is mineralised for plants to use depends on the C:N ratio of the substrate material and the type of micro-organisms. When the C:N &gt; 25, there is no excess N and all N is immobilised by the micro-organisms. When C:N &lt; 25, some mineralisation (see glossary) of N is likely. Lignin, a complex phenolic polymer, makes up 10% to 20% of cereal straw dry matter and 20% to 30% of wood dry matter. It is not easily decomposed. When it is decomposed, monocyclic phenols are formed and these are then used by soil organisms to make humic macro-molecules. 1.10 Soil organisms One way of classifying soil organisms is by the method they use to make food: heterotrophs need C in the form of organic molecules; they include many species of bacteria and all fungi; autotrophs include remaining bacteria and most algae; can grow using C from CO2, deriving energy from sunlight (i.e. photosynthetic bacteria and algae) or else deriving energy from oxidising inorganic compounds (i.e. chemoautotrophs). Another way of classifying them is according to their need for molecular O2: aerobes need O2 as the terminal electron acceptor in respiration facultative anaerobes normally need O2 but can survive in anoxic conditions by using NO3- and other inorganic compounds as electron acceptors in respiration obligate anaerobes grow only in oxygen-free environments because oxygen is toxic to them 1.11 Humus Ageing plant material is invaded by micro-organisms that begin to decompose it. At the same time, biochemical changes occur in that ageing material, breaking down cell membranes. Plant material eventually falls to the ground, is invaded by many soil organisms and decomposition quickens, as shown by increasing CO2 production. This leads to: immobilisation of elements by micro-organisms (i.e. micro-organisms use elements for growth) mineralisation of elements, making them available for plants synthesis of new compounds that form a dark brown to black shapeless material called humus This process of breaking down litter, releasing mineral nutrients and synthesising new compounds is humification. The biochemical changes that occur in organic matter in the soil during decomposition and humus formation are complex! White (pp. 48-49) mentions some. Two important features of humus are: humification produces organic colloids that have a high CEC the CEC of soil organic matter depends completely on pH the most important functional groups containing oxygen are those that dissociate to produce H+ ions and are the carboxylic and phenolic groups; carboxylic groups have a pK value between 3 and 5 and phenolic groups only release protons if pH &gt; 7 (Note: For an acid, HA + H2O \\(\\rightleftharpoons\\) H3O+ + A-, Ka = [H3O+][A-] / [HA] and pK = -log10K; e.g. for acetic acid, CH3COOH, Ka = 1.8 \\(\\times\\) 10-5 and pK = 4.74; for formic acid, HCOOH, Ka = 1.8 \\(\\times\\) 10-4 and pK = 3.74) humic compounds can form coordination complexes with metallic cations, producing a chelate compound; phenolic groups are involved in this (see figure below). "],["plants.html", "2 Plants 2.1 Plant classification 2.2 Primary and secondary growth", " 2 Plants 2.1 Plant classification Plants can be classified in more than one way. The method you choose depends on what differences you want to highlight. One method divides plants into those with vascular tissue and those with non-vascular tissue. Vascular tissue transports water and nutrients up the roots and stems. The diagram below is simplified and does not include all plant groups. As it is based on whether vascular tissue is present, it highlights the evolution of water independence in plants. Non-vascular plants (e.g. mosses) need to live in or near a moist environment. Vascular plants (e.g. ferns and seed-bearing plants), on the other hand, can live in drier environments as they can obtain water through their roots. Dividing plants into spore-bearing and seed-bearing plants focusses on the ways in which plants reproduce. Gymnosperms and angiosperms bear seeds, while all other plants reproduce via spores. Seeds gave plants a better chance of survival. (Reference: https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/Book%3A_Introductory_Biology_(CK-12)/09%3A_Plants/9.06%3A_Plant_Classification) Ferns are the class Filicinae. Gymnosperms are a class and include the orders Conifers, Cycads and Gingko. They produce seeds in cones and do not flower. Angiosperms are a class and are divided into the sub-classes Monocots (or Liliopsida) (e.g. palms, grasses) and Dicots (or Magnoliopsida) (e.g. flowering trees, shrubs and climbers) and produce seeds in flowers. Under Kingdom, the next taxonomic rank is division (in botany) and phylum (in zoology). 2.1.1 Suffixes in taxonomic ranks in botany (See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank) Division: -ophyta Class: -opsida Subclass: -idae Order: -ales Family: -aceae Subfamily: -oideae 2.2 Primary and secondary growth Primary growth results from cell division in the tips of the stem and roots and results in the stems and roots lengthening. Secondary growth results from cell division in the cambium, producing xylem on the inside and phloem on the outside and so causing the stem to thicken. Secondary growth occurs in dicots and gymnosperms but not usually in monocots. Monocots may have “anomalous secondary growth”. Palms, for example, increase their stem diameter by parenchyma cells dividing and enlarging, a process where no secondary xylem or phloem is formed (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_growth). Parenchyma cells are a type of ground tissue, which is tissue that is not on the external surface of plants or part of vascular tissue. It’s a type of “filler” tissue in the soft parts of plants (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_tissue). There are different types of anomalous secondary growth in other monocots.

The qualities of growing media must match the growth phase of the plants: seed germination / rooting cuttings, potting up, potting on. 3.6.1 Seed propagation free from pests and disease high water-holding capacity to maintain uniform moisture around seeds 3.6.2 Cuttings free from pests and disease very porous good drainage, as cuttings are often misted and so the growing medium must not become waterlogged high aeration or air-filled porosity (i.e. a high percentage of macropores) to encourage root growth 3.6.3 Transplant or potting on media Plants in this growth phase have actively growing roots, shoots and leaves, can support themselves, absorb nutrients and produce their own food. free from pests and disease coarser than seed propagation or cuttings media well-aerated and drained (i.e. holding more air (oxygen)) good water-holding and nutrient holding capacity to satisfy the needs of actively growing plants (i.e. actively growing roots, shoots and leaves) initially, water-holding capacity is less than seed raising and tubing up mixes but increases as organic components decompose heavy enough so plants stay upright (i.e. more sand) may contain some fertiliser N.B. The type of potting mix used for potting on depends on the type of plant, the conditions (e.g. more protected or less protected) it will grow under, season and irrigation method. Potting on mixes can be general or made to suit the needs of particular plants (e.g. orchids, azaleas). 3.6.4 Establishment media In this growth phase, plants have well-developed root and shoot systems and can support themselves, absorb nutrients and produce and store their own food. They need to be able to cope with an environment with few climatic controls. The emphasis here is on keeping the plant healthy and not encouraging it to grow excessively. free from pests and disease lower aeration and drainage than other mixes to allow for slower growth rates and less maintenance high water-holding and nutrient-holding capacity (due to less maintenance) ballast (i.e. more sand) for stability for plants remaining in containers for the long-term, the media must resist decomposing - the particles must remain stable to maintain growing conditions; sand can be used to provide the smallest particles "],["weeds.html", "4 Weeds 4.1 Weeding techniques", " 4 Weeds 4.1 Weeding techniques 4.1.1 Crowning The crown is the part of the plant that sits just below the surface of the soil.
