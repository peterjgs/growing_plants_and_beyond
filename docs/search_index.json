The method you choose depends on what differences you want to highlight. One method divides plants into those with vascular tissue and those with non-vascular tissue. Vascular tissue transports water and nutrients up the roots and stems. The diagram below is simplified and does not include all plant groups. As it is based on whether vascular tissue is present, it highlights the evolution of water independence in plants. Non-vascular plants (e.g. mosses) need to live in or near a moist environment. Vascular plants (e.g. ferns and seed-bearing plants), on the other hand, can live in drier environments as they can obtain water through their roots. Dividing plants into spore-bearing and seed-bearing plants focusses on the ways in which plants reproduce. Gymnosperms and angiosperms bear seeds, while all other plants reproduce via spores. Seeds gave plants a better chance of survival. (Reference: https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/Book%3A_Introductory_Biology_(CK-12)/09%3A_Plants/9.06%3A_Plant_Classification) Ferns are the class Filicinae. Gymnosperms are a class and include the orders Conifers, Cycads and Gingko. They produce seeds in cones and do not flower. Angiosperms are a class and are divided into the sub-classes Monocots (or Liliopsida) (e.g. palms, grasses) and Dicots (or Magnoliopsida) (e.g. flowering trees, shrubs and climbers) and produce seeds in flowers. Under Kingdom, the next taxonomic rank is division (in botany) and phylum (in zoology). 2.1.1 Suffixes in taxonomic ranks in botany (See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank) Division: -ophyta Class: -opsida Subclass: -idae Order: -ales Family: -aceae Subfamily: -oideae "],["glossary---plants.html", "3 Glossary - Plants", " 3 Glossary - Plants A motley collection of plant-related terms front-line salt tolerant This refers to plants that can tolerate full coastal exposure and that have foliage that can withstand salt spray and salt-laden winds (Reference for front-line and second-line salt tolerance: https://www.austplants.com.au/resources/Pictures/Central%20Coast%20District%20Group/4COSTALP.pdf). second-line salt tolerant This refers to plants that can tolerate moderate coastal exposure and that grow best if protected from salt-laden winds. In exposed positions on the coast, they could be grown behind a protective screen of front-line salt tolerant plants.
