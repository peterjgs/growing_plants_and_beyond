# Glossary - Plants

A motley collection of plant-related terms

**front-line salt tolerant** This refers to plants that can tolerate full coastal exposure and that have foliage that can withstand salt spray and salt-laden winds (Reference for front-line and second-line salt tolerance: https://www.austplants.com.au/resources/Pictures/Central%20Coast%20District%20Group/4COSTALP.pdf).

**second-line salt tolerant** This refers to plants that can tolerate moderate coastal exposure and that grow best if protected from salt-laden winds.  In exposed positions on the coast, they could be grown behind a protective screen of front-line salt tolerant plants.
