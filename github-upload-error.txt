If pushing to Github doesn't work because of an error like this, "RPC failed; HTTP 400 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 400 send-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet", it's probably because too much data is being uploaded. Increase buffer size by running:

git config http.postBuffer 524288000
