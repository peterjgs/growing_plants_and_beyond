# Growing media

A growing medium is a material through which plant roots grow and from which they extract water and nutrients.

## Functions of growing media

- physical support
    - growing medium must support the plant or cutting but stay porous
    - large plants need ballast in the medium to hold plant upright

- aeration
    - plant roots need oxygen so they can convert sugar into energy to grow
    - this process produces carbon dioxide, which needs to be removed from the root zone to prevent toxic concentrations building up
    - this gas exchange occurs in the macropores
    
- water supply
    - growing media hold water in the micropores
    - they need enough porosity to store the required amounts of water
    - organic material is one of the main components of growing media that absorb and hold water
    
- nutrient supply
    - most nutrients are obtained by a plant through its roots from the potting medium
    - most nutrients are cations
    - the potting medium must contain materials which can hold these cations
    - the capacity of a material to hold cations is *cation exchange capacity* (CEC)
    - potting media components can vary widely in CEC
    
 
## Physical properties of growing media

- water-holding capacity
    - this is the percentage of total pore space that stays filled with water after letting water drain under gravity
    - a growing medium needs good water holding capacity and good drainage
    - it has good drainage if it has enough macropores to let water drain away and prevent waterlogging
    - compaction is important to take into account - if the medium is compacted, the proportion of macropores is reduced and the roots will be deprived of oxygen
    
- aeration
    - the percentage of pore space that is filled with air after excess water has drained away is aeration
    - oxygen is supplied to and carbon dioxide is removed from the root zone through the macropores
    - a good growing medium needs a high percentage of macropores
    
- porosity
    - total porosity is the sum of the volume of macropores and the volume of micropores - plants need both adequate macropores and micropores
    - a medium with mainly larger particles will have higher aeration and lower water-holding capacity than a medium with mainly smaller particles, which will have lower aeration and higher water-holding capacity - neither is probably satisfactory
    
    
    
## Growing media for particular purposes

### Root cuttings

- a high percentage of macropores (i.e. high aeration) is needed
